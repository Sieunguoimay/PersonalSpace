        A Poem from Dead Poets Society:

    <div class="row" style="font-style:italic">
        <p>
            "I went to the woods
            because I wanted to live deliberately...<br>
            I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life!<br>
            To put to rout all that was not life...<br>
            And not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived..."<br>
        </p>
